In Next.js 15, a subtle issue can occur when using server components with deeply nested layouts or components that rely on data fetching within the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` functions.  If a deeply nested component attempts to access data fetched by a parent component's `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, it might not have access to the data due to asynchronous data fetching and the way data is passed down through the component tree. This leads to undefined or null values in the child component, resulting in runtime errors or unexpected behavior. This is particularly problematic if error handling isn't rigorously implemented.
